      Don&#39;t Blame it on React or Redux
    </h1>
  </header>

  <p>What most people don’t know when they first get into Redux is that, just like React, Redux itself is meant to be <strong>simple</strong>. And as seen that simplicity is a goal, both React and Redux <em>won’t</em> and <em>don’t want</em> to tell you how to solve everything.</p>
<p>They won’t tell you how to deal with side effects, or what HTTP request library you should use. That’s completely delegated to the JavaScript ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>React and Redux alone don’t do much for really complex web applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>React indirectly delegates state management problems to solutions like Flux. On the other hand, Redux, for instance, delegates dealing with async stuff or even the <em>too-much-boilerplate</em> problem that people complain.</p>
<p>But <strong>what motivates React and Redux to be that way?</strong> Some reasons I can think of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both libraries are highly focused on their principles, not the built-in stuff. The efficiency of them is on the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em>, not the <em>what</em>.</li>
<li>They aim to be a great fit for both simple <em>and</em> large applications, so the “plug-in-play” approach is followed. (A framework wouldn’t ever do everything a programmer needs anyway…)</li>
<li>Diversity of solutions. Because React and Redux are more like “plug-in-play”, the “plugins” (tools, libraries, middlewares) will evolve by themselves. For instance: <a href="https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios">axios</a>, a HTTP request library, will evolve in parallel to Redux itself – which certainly make things move forward faster!</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>If your application’s state is messy, don’t blame it on React.  If you find yourself writing too much boilerplate, don’t blame it on Redux. <strong>React and Redux don’t really do much</strong>, but this is by design.</p>
<p>React is awesome not just because it makes it possible to turn a large and complex application into simple components.</p>
<p>Redux is awesome not just because it makes it effortless to deal with and share state throughout an application.</p>
<p>They’re also awesome because of <strong>their great and diverse ecosystem</strong>. So, when you buy into React or Redux, it’s better for you to buy into their ecosystem too.</p>
