And as seen that simplicity is a goal, both React and Redux <em>won’t</em> and <em>don’t want</em> to tell you how to solve everything.<p>They won’t tell you how to deal with side effects, or what HTTP request library you should use. That’s completely delegated to the JavaScript ecosystem.<p><strong>React and Redux alone don’t do much for really complex web applications.</strong><p>React indirectly delegates state management problems to solutions like Flux. On the other hand, Redux, for instance, delegates dealing with async stuff or even the <em>too-much-boilerplate</em> problem that people complain.<p>But <strong>what motivates React and Redux to be that way?</strong> Some reasons I can think of are:<ul><li>Both libraries are highly focused on their principles, not the built-in stuff. The efficiency of them is on the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em>, not the <em>what</em>.<li>They aim to be a great fit for both simple <em>and</em> large applications, so the “plug-in-play” approach is followed. (A framework wouldn’t ever do everything a programmer needs anyway…)<li>Diversity of solutions. Because React and Redux are more like “plug-in-play”, the “plugins” (tools, libraries, middlewares) will evolve by themselves. For instance: <a href=https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios>axios</a>, a HTTP request library, will evolve in parallel to Redux itself – which certainly make things move forward faster!</ul><hr><p>If your application’s state is messy, don’t blame it on React. If you find yourself writing too much boilerplate, don’t blame it on Redux. <strong>React and Redux don’t really do much</strong>, but this is by design.<p>React is awesome not just because it makes it possible to turn a large and complex application into simple components.<p>Redux is awesome not just because it makes it effortless to deal with and share state throughout an application.<p>They’re also awesome because of <strong>their great and diverse ecosystem</strong>. So, when you buy into React or Redux, it’s better for you to buy into their ecosystem too.</div></article></div></body><script src=/footnotes.js></script>
