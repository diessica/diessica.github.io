Reading sparks new ideas—yet often we merely seek out validation for the ones we already have. <em>We misunderstand learning.</em> We cling to theory like a lifeline, as though it can stand on its own, while overlooking the experimental space where it transforms: practice. Perhaps we gamify it. (Unlearning our addictions is another matter entirely.) We escape the confusion that must linger–it slips us that lingering isn’t forever. <em>We misunderstand learning.</em> Through edutainment, we satisfy the illusion of smooth progress, estimated reading times, chapter after chapter. True learning is too disjointed, unpredictable, and fraught with setbacks. We obsess over minimising gaps between repetitions, but are these gaps learning breaks, or learning itself? I recall the first time I picked up a guitar: my fingers aching to stretch, shredding like crazy against the strings. The morning after, I played the chord—not through conscious effort or passion, but because my fingers developed dexterity and calluses overnight. <em>We misunderstand learning.</em> Technique matters, yes, but some processes of embedding patterns are handled by our bodies in their own time. Others always seem to have it easier, so we feel ashamed. I won’t lie–some do have it easier. But most often we don’t know, we weren’t there to see behind the ease, and nobody’s quite vulnerable these days.<p>We misunderstand learning, but once, we were in intimate touch with it. Back when we hadn’t yet been subjected to environments of comparison, deadlines, narrow molds, and had our complexities and neuro-diversities amassed into pure functions. I’m still not immune to this. At times, learning as an adult feels like a endless chase of the instinctive dance of curiosity it once was. Throw at it: Pomodoro timers, habit trackers and productivity hacks. Yet, it’s only when I sit down to an unmysterious learning practice and truly welcome confusion, chaos, and seeming non-productivity that I feel like I can dance with curiosity again, and learn.</div></article></div></body><script src=/footnotes.js></script>
