<p>Then into your life, there comes a darkness<br />
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky<br />
And thereâ€™s nowhere to hide<br />
You run to the back and you cover your ears<br />
But itâ€™s the loudest sound youâ€™ve ever heard <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><cite>Radiohead</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Itâ€™s weird. I mean, as small children, weâ€™re <em>truly</em> vulnerable to life. We donâ€™t know how to talk, walk, or take care of ourselves. We rely completely on other people for everything, and we have no clue on how the future looks like â€“ more than ever! We just started, so there are an entire person to make and an entire life to live.</p>
<p>What if we donâ€™t make it? It sounds quite terrifying. Yet, while kids, our hearts donâ€™t race, we sleep well, our stomachs are fine, we donâ€™t avoid things (far from it!), our hands donâ€™t shake, we breath properly, and our chest doesnâ€™t feel tight. At least, not out of the blue.</p>
<p>We find no panic on living, even that we donâ€™t really know anything. We donâ€™t feel overwhelmed about whatâ€™s going to happen, and if we do, the thought of it will just come and go â€“Â it wonâ€™t turn into an obsession.</p>
<p>As we grow, however, we begin knowing a lot. We get aware of things, sometimes too much. Plus, if something is unknown to us, it isnâ€™t hard to get to know it. We get less vulnerable to life, in a sense.</p>
<p>Still, sometimes it feels like all this knowledge and awareness only make us yet more vulnerable to everything, as if something went wrong as we were growing up. Itâ€™s even possible that we get so lost in the thought of life itself that we completely forget to live it â€“ a thing a kid wouldnâ€™t ever do.</p>
<p>Well, at least we donâ€™t have an adultâ€™s head while weâ€™re children. If we did, I guess weâ€™d be afraid of everything in such a way thatâ€™d never let us really grow up, so weâ€™d only grow old.</p>
