Why?<ul><li>I love keyboard navigation, and vim motions invite you to use your entire keyboard not only to type, going beyond the Ctrl+Shift+Command+Fn+^+{+/ hell.<li>neovim’s plugin ecosystem is GOLD for keyboard enthusiasts e.g. <a href=https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim>stevearc/oil.nvim</a>.<li>There’s a gap between my terminal and VS Code. No matter what extensions I throw at it, I can’t bridge it. Since I spend a lot of time in the terminal anyway, why not edit in it too?</ul><p class=note>Disclaimer: Not a beginner tutorial. Rather a (hopefully inspiring) diary of my vim journey. But if you're curious, I've dropped some learning resources below.<h2 id=today-i-learned>Today I learned</h2><h3 id=which-vim-editor>which vim editor?</h3><p>Many editors support vim motions, including VS Code itself. Technically, I could just <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/1enlqx1/my_minimal_vscode_setup_heavily_inspired_by_neovim/>make my VS Code more keyboard-centric</a> without switching editors. But right now, I’m exploring <a href=https://neovim.io/>neovim</a>, and learning vim motions across both VS Code and neovim. neovim is cute: small, fast, portable, extendable, widely supported, and not again owned by Microsoft.<h3 id=vim-kinda-has-4-modes>vim kinda has 4 modes</h3><ul><li>insert mode (<code>i</code> key; also other keys, see “the normal mode”): where you type and insert text, just like a traditional text editor.<li>visual mode (<code>v</code> key): where you select/highlight text visually, handy for copying/deleting/moving.<li>normal mode (<code>esc</code> key): where you navigate around the file, most of the time and most efficiently. Keys become “motions” and “operators” that move the cursor and act on text (deleting, finding, replacing).<li>command-line mode (<code>:</code> key): execute commands on vim, mostly editor-related, e.g. saving files, exiting vim.</ul><p>Traditional text editors offer ways to do the above in a permanent “insert mode”, but vim separates that across modes. Many mistakes happen because you’re not in the mode you thought you were, it helped me that the “normal” mode cursor looks different than the other modes.<h3 id=the-normal-mode>the normal mode</h3><p>There’s nothing normal about the normal mode, so I will say again: in vim’s normal mode, keys turn into “motions” (move you around the file) and “operators” (act on text, e.g. deleting, finding, replacing). Think of it as a mode with permanently enabled “Cmd” or “Ctrl” keys which you use to move around in a regular text editor (I hope?).<ol><li>navigating up (k), down (j), left (h), right (k). (Try not to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing>press l with your pinky finger</a>)<li>creating new lines under the cursor (o) and above (O)<li>jumping to next word (w), end of the word (e), or previous word (b)<li>jumping around lines of code with gg (line 0), G (end of file), {line number you wanna go to}G, {N}j to go down N lines, {N}k to go up N lines<li>inserting before cursor (i), inserting after cursor (a), insert in the beginning of line (I) or end of line (A)<li>jumping to beginning of the line (0), end of line ($), or beginning of word (_)<li>replacing a char (r) or word (R), deleting current character (x), deleting (d) e.g. a line (dd), next word (dw), previous word (db), basically a lot of the commands I’ve already learned above<li>searching within a line with f(character), plus next (n) and previous (N) occurrence<li>undo (u), redo (ctl+r). Pretty damn important, you make mistakes all the time.</ol><p>I practiced these commands in roughly that order, moving on once I felt <em>mostly accurate, though still slow</em>. It might seem like a lot, but it’s easier when it’s about muscle memory and not memorizing a cheatsheet. Once you start combining motions and operators, things get fun. For example: I already use <code>j</code> to move down, could <code>10j</code> jump down 10 lines? Yes (first I tried <code>j10</code> lol). Deleting 3 words backwards? <code>d3b</code>.<h3 id=little-vim-config>little vim config</h3><p>Feeling a bit lost in my editor, had to change some things. I said earlier I was curious about the ecosystem, but now I’m a little overwhelmed.

Coding was already confusing enough, and I figured, “what’s the point of typing faster if I don’t even know what to type?”. Which was pretty wise, in hindsight. Pretty sure I peaked in wisdom right there.<p>Jokes aside (it was not a joke), I’m still far from hyper-productive on vim. But I wrote this blog post with it, felt focused and felt plenty of fun, which is productive enough I guess? Whether this is novelty, or the vim advantage, only time will tell. Plenty of people go from VS Code to neovim and then back again. Who knows.<p>Now, the text column width on this editor has been full screen since I started this post, and I’m on the edge of installing <a href=https://github.com/folke/zen-mode.nvim>zen-mode.nvim</a>. Just gotta figure out what is this lazy nvim vs. packer thing.<p>:wq</div></article></div></body><script src=/footnotes.js></script>
