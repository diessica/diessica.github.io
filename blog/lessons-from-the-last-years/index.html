      Lessons from the Last Years
    </h1>
  </header>

  <p>I’ve made a point of being in challenging situations whenever possible.</p>
<p>In the last years, most of them were challenging in a social and career perspective. Both my personal and professional life benefited from that decision: I got to learn a lot about people, relationships, business, productivity and, last but not least, myself.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I’m not selfish enough to not to share some lessons I’ve learned.</p>
<p>I hope you benefit from them too.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Be kind to people.</li>
<li>Be kind to yourself. It means, rather than comparing yourself to others, respect your journey and understand you’ve had different circumstances and opportunities.</li>
<li>Save money every month, even if it’s a little. Don’t wait for an emergency or a special event.</li>
<li>Authority doesn’t actually mean anything. Kindness does. (If you ever run a business, don’t ever let it get out of your mind.)</li>
<li>When it comes to a serious question, asking it by texting will make you miss a lot of answers.</li>
<li>Have your goals in mind rather writing them down. When it comes to productivity, writing down a planning for reaching a goal works better.</li>
<li>Growing up takes courage.</li>
<li>Hate is a waste of time. Social networks too. You cannot get rid of them, so just make sure they both aren’t taking over the person you are.</li>
<li>There are always deadlines. Try not to let them be a pressure in your life.</li>
<li>If you get to ask yourself <em>“What if I screw up and make the wrong call?”</em>, remember that probably the situation you’re dealing with isn’t a brain surgery. It doesn’t have to – and probably won’t – be thoroughly perfect.</li>
<li>Getting simple things done everyday can get you motivated to do the great ones.</li>
<li><strong>Words are powerful</strong>. Choose them carefully.</li>
<li>Practicing empathy everyday increases your perspective on society.</li>
<li>Sometimes you’re wrong – and there’s nothing wrong about that.</li>
<li>Having communication skills doesn’t mean you are socially mature.</li>
<li>There will be moments you’ll have to say sorry. Don’t miss them.</li>
<li>Give something back.</li>
</ol>
