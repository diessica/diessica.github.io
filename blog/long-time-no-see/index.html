More time üå≥ offline ‚õ∞Ô∏è, which was great. Then a demanding role in a small team, the chaotic grip of a global pandemic, increasing perfectionism, and a blossoming and ultimately collapsing relationship ‚Äì which all conspired to shake up my pursuits and thrust me into an introspective whirlwind. And as if that wasn‚Äôt difficult enough, I lost two years‚Äô worth of drafts in a backup blunder.<p>Whenever I attempted to restart, I found myself entangled in a web of what still resonated with me and what no longer did. But hey, listing more excuses would only scratch the surface. I recognize now, after seeing how little it takes for me to be back, that parts of me were simply in disarray. Yet, as I come together again, so does my motivation to reclaim what I enjoy, and make time for it despite the busyness and excuses.<p>So, last night, I did what I do best: I embarked on an in-one-sitting endeavor! I migrated this blog to <a href=https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/>Zola</a> (a speedy static generator written in Rust), so this WeBpAg3 remains therefore static and snappy af, joining the <a href=https://512kb.club/>&LT512 kB club</a>. Letting my creativity flow with <a href=https://tailwindcss.com/>Tailwind</a>, I gave my WeBpAg3 an extravagant-outrageous look, and made sure it‚Äôs accessible. I rewrote my introduction like a million times. I sifted through my writings, organising and archiving some, and lo and behold!: I stumbled upon those lost drafts hidden away in the depths of my physical backups. <em>Pretty thrilling.</em> As a friend once told me, <strong>good things happen when good things happen</strong>.<p>Long time no see! It all feels quite nice, if you ask me. üòâ</div></article></div></body><script src=/footnotes.js></script>
