<p>A state in which people are locked in their own heads. Where everything they do makes sense.</p>
</div>
<p>I was a young girl when I started to get into computers. Definitely spent a lot of time alone, so I’ve ended up entering adult life with a lot of thoughts that only made sense in my head.</p>
<p>One of them was that solitude is <strong>freedom</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Years ago, I read a book called called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16631.Steppenwolf">Steppenwolf</a>. The book talks about Harry Haller, a man who proudly craved solitude. At some point, he says:</p>
<p><em>“Solitude is independence. It had been my wish and with the years I had attained it. It was cold. Oh, cold enough! But it was also still, wonderfully still and vast like the cold stillness of space in which the stars revolve.”</em></p>
<p>Maybe <strong>independence</strong> is the word I couldn’t come up with.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’d think: <em>I’m on my own, after all. Who could ever possibly stop or judge me?</em> Think about the question. <em>Nobody, right?</em></p>
<p>It’s just easy to get it all wrong. At that time, of course I was wrong about the answer.  I forgot an important person: me. Nobody could ever stop or judge me… Except <em>myself</em>. When you’re alone, you still have your own company – and I’ve neglected this part.</p>
<p>Our minds just cannot handle being open only to ourselves. Inevitably, dark thoughts are made up; however they aren’t perceived as irrational unless you leave your own world.</p>
<p>So it didn’t take longer for me to start judging and stopping myself harder than people could ever do. Does it sound like freedom?</p>
<p>Years after, I don’t think so.</p>
