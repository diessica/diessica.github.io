      I Travelled to Photographs

  <p>February was ending.</p>
<p>Usually, such thing would mean regular summer days. However, it wasn’t summer or even a regular day – this was something else.</p>
<p>February 25th was winter. In that cold afternoon, I ended up into a place I’ll never forget: photographs from my phone’s gallery.</p>
<hr>
<p>My steps were slow.</p>
<p>Red bricks erected the walls of houses built on top of an equally red-bricked avenue.</p>
<p>The windows of the houses were made of a wood strategically white-colored to match the brick’s white grouts. With such detail, it was pretty easy to forgive the toughness those bricks carried.</p>
<p>Houses ended themselves in grey roofing shingles. The roofs were all hipped. <em>Houses with hip roofs, gotta love them!</em>, I thought to myself. (Imagine the “V” letter upside down on top of a square – that’s a house with a hip roof.)</p>
<p>Showing a winter that was already leaving, dark trees with dry twigs were in contrast against a white sky – the whitest I’d ever seen in my life. <em>Damn!</em> The whole picture looked like a painting, while the white sky worked as the canvas board on which all that was drawn.</p>
<p>I remember walking and trying to get everything I could, until a freezing wind blew abruptly into my face. It was February, though. From where I come, February meant summer, not freezing winds. Why was February that cold?</p>
<p>In an attempt to clear things up, I told myself what I believed that was true: <em>You’re just looking at photographs from your phone’s gallery. There’s no need to get this excited!</em> Ok. So I was home and looking at the “Wallpapers” album I had on my phone.</p>
<p>A moment later, I found myself facing a large and wonderful canal, in which someone was solitary paddling a boat to somewhere. <em>What a view.</em></p>
<p>Then, self-awareness hit me again: <em>Wait. Isn’t my smartphone in my pocket?</em> How could I be possibly looking at photographs on it?</p>
<p>I immediately started touching my entire body in a desperate hunt for my phone. And there it was. In my fucking coat. It wasn’t really possible for me to see photographs on my phone – that shit was in my pocket all the time.</p>
<p>Besides, why would I be wearing a coat on summer? And, if I was already wearing a coat, how could I be still cold? How inappropriate were my clothes for that weather? Only a person who sensed that winter solely with the eyes would underestimate its coldness like that!</p>
<p>The boat was really leaving through the canal. The view wasn’t photographs. What was all that, then?</p>
<p>I got my phone from my pocket, turned off airplane mode, and opened the Maps app. <em>Come on, where am I?</em></p>
<p>“Noorder Amstelkanaal”, I read. <em>Wow.</em></p>
<p>All of a sudden, February 25th was a cold winter in Amsterdam. My very first one.</p>

<p>I guess I travelled to photographs.</p>
