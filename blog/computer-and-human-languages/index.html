I told him I was <em>fluent</em>.<p>– <em>Fluent? What does it mean to be fluent?</em><p>– <em>Well, think Portuguese.</em> – We both speak Portuguese — <em>I don’t know every word, but I do know the language enough to express anything I need somehow.</em><p>It turned out that “fluent” was just the perfect word.<hr><p>Fluency is a powerful and straightforward concept to express your ability with a language. When it comes to <strong>human languages</strong>, it’s the ability to fully communicate your intentions to a human; for <strong>computer languages</strong>, the ability to fully communicate your intentions to a computer.<p>That line of thought is shared in one of the most important and revolutionary introductory books to Computer Science. In <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>, right before introducing Lisp (the programming language used throughout the book) a similar analogy is made:<blockquote><p>Just as our everyday thoughts are usually expressed in our natural language (such as English, French, or Japanese), and descriptions of quantitative phenomena are expressed with mathematical notations, our procedural thoughts will be expressed in Lisp. <sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#1>1</a></sup></blockquote><p>For both kinds of languages, the levels are the same: one <em>cannot</em> communicate; <em>can poorly</em> do it (beginner); <em>can</em> do it (native/fluent), or <em>can brilliantly</em> do it (think book authors, public speakers, and Software Engineers in a senior level).<h2 id=why-do-they-match-so-well>Why do they match so well?</h2><p>They match because the linguistics of computer and natural languages wonderfully intersect. Both consist of <strong>syntax</strong>, <strong>semantics</strong> and <strong>pragmatics</strong> functions, found in the core of theoretical linguistics.<p>In their ecosystem, we can also find <strong>syntax trees</strong> and different <strong>style guides</strong>.<h3 id=syntax>Syntax</h3><p><strong>Syntax</strong> is the set of rules that govern how language elements are combined to form a valid expression.<p>In English, the basic rule is that elements like nouns, verbs and punctuation marks must follow the <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object>subject-verb-object order</a> to produce a valid sentence. In JavaScript, a programming language, to produce a valid conditional statement, elements such as <code>if</code>, parenthesis, braces, comparison operators (<code>===</code>, <code><=</code> ) must be combined in a certain order too.<p>In the same way that “Do they car a put?” (??) is not valid English, the following code is not valid JavaScript:<pre class=language-js data-lang=js style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=color:#ff79c6>if </span><span>{</span><span style=color:#bd93f9>1 </span><span style=color:#ff79c6>=== </span><span style=color:#bd93f9>2</span><span>} (
</span><span>  </span><span style=color:#fff>return </span><span style=color:#bd93f9>true
</span><span>)
</span><span style=color:#6272a4>// => SyntaxError: missing ( before condition

</span></code></pre><p class=note>And just like a pedant friend would do when you write shitty English, the computer will throw a syntax error when running your program. Forgot closing a brace? Wrote an <code>if</code> statement condition using curly braces instead of parenthesis? Well, <code>SyntaxError</code>!<p>This, however, is valid JavaScript:<pre class=language-js data-lang=js style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=color:#ff79c6>if </span><span>(</span><span style=color:#bd93f9>1 </span><span style=color:#ff79c6>=== </span><span style=color:#bd93f9>2</span><span>) {

</span></code></pre><p>In HTML there are syntax rules too. Adding a <code>div</code> inside <code>ul</code>, for instance, is invalid. An unordered list in HTML (<code>ul</code>) only allows list items as children, such as <code>li</code> – and <code>div</code> is not one.<p>Languages have different degrees of syntax strictness, which is what usually makes some harder to grasp than others. Think the <strong>German language</strong> – German imposes very strict rules for articles: they may vary in number, gender, and function. English, on the other hand, has a definite (the) and an indefinite article (a/an) – and that’s it.<p>The same applies to computer languages: some happen to be extremely strict when it comes to syntax, while others are designed for greater syntactic flexibility, letting you achieve the same result in different ways. Think <strong>semicolons</strong>: they are optional when ending statements in JavaScript, but mandatory in C.<h3 id=semantics>Semantics</h3><p><strong>Semantics</strong> is what the language expression evaluates to. In human languages, expressions evaluate to thoughts, questions, answers; while computers evaluate expressions to CPU instructions that comprise a program’s flow.<p>Consider the following English statement:<blockquote><p>The ant ran over the car.</blockquote><p>I don’t know what ants you are familiar with, but even though the sentence contains the necessary elements in correct order and grammar, that doesn’t make sense. The statement is <strong>syntactically correct</strong> but <strong>semantically wrong</strong> – we can’t conceive a meaning from it.<p>(<em>“The car ran over the ant”</em>, however, would be definitely more acceptable to our ears.)<p>We can relate semantics to computer languages in several ways (like “solving the wrong problem”, basically), but the “semantic” word bubbles up more often when we think about HTML. Consider the following markup:<pre class=language-html data-lang=html style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36><code class=language-html data-lang=html><span><</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>span</span><span>>What is a fruit?&LT/</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>span</span><span>>
</span><span><</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>div</span><span>>
</span><span>    A fruit is something that humans eat. Some examples of fruits are:
</span><span>    watermelon, pineapple and apples.
</span><span>&LT/</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>div</span><span>>
</span></code></pre><p>The elements <code>span</code> and <code>div</code> do exist in the language and are validly marked in this case (I didn’t do <code>>div<</code>, right?), so the browser will understand and show it accordingly to the user. The syntax is correct; yet, <code>span</code> and <code>divs</code> are non-semantic elements, so computers won’t get any meaning from it. Again, <strong>syntactically correct</strong> but <strong>semantically wrong</strong>.<p>That text, though, is clearly a title and a paragraph. With a bit of HTML knowledge, we can communicate this in a meaningful way to computers! The language provides elements to achieve that.<p>The following code improves the previous markup for better semantics.<pre class=language-html data-lang=html style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36><code class=language-html data-lang=html><span><</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>h1</span><span>>What is a fruit?&LT/</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>h1</span><span>>
</span><span><</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>p</span><span>>
</span><span>    A fruit is something that humans eat. Some examples of fruits are:
</span><span>    watermelon, pineapple and apples.
</span><span>&LT/</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>p</span><span>>
</span></code></pre><p>The element <code>h1</code> is being used to communicate the main title, and <code>p</code> communicates the paragraph. Both syntax and semantics make sense now!<h3 id=pragmatics>Pragmatics</h3><p><strong>Pragmatics</strong> is what the language expression evaluates to within its interactional context – which might totally affect semantics and syntax.<p>In a natural language, the context is essentially built around the cultural aspects of the speaker, place, time, manner, and several others unpredictable aspects that humans introduce when communicating.<p>For computer languages, we can see pragmatics as the methodology or implementation used when approaching a problem: composition vs. inheritance, functional vs. imperative, picking a Design Pattern etc.<p>Consider the following examples:<ul><li>A child saying that the food is horrible to a beginner that started cooking just recently.<li>A new joiner in the company filters items in an JavaScript array using <code>forEach</code>, but the team expected <code>filter</code> to be used – a more functional approach.<li>A programmer implements Fibonacci with recursion instead of iteration.<li>Your friend uses a very erudite language to add a cake recipe on the internet.</ul><p>What do they all have in common? By themselves, they are neither right or wrong – <em>unless</em> you consider the context in which they were approached in.<p>Having either syntax or semantic skills won’t help you understand what’s wrong, since pragmatics is more about what’s <strong>appropriate</strong> within a context. Some approaches are more elegant, antiquated, or dialect-based than others, and we can only tell how valid they are considering what we are trying to achieve.<h3 id=syntax-trees>Syntax trees</h3><p>Both kinds of languages can be represented using syntax trees, a concept that reuses the mathematical concept of <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set>partially ordered sets</a>.<p>Human languages are analysed through the Concrete Syntax Tree (“CST”), a context-free analysis that tells us about the function of each language token (word, punctuation etc) used.<p>This is the Concrete Syntax Tree for the previous sentence, <em>“The water drank a glass of Mary.”</em>:<figure class=text-center><picture><img alt="Concrete Syntax Tree of the sentence 'The water drank a glass of Mary.'" src=../../media/2018/mary-glass-syntax-tree.png></picture><figcaption>Concrete Syntax Tree for a sentence in a human language, where "S" stands for "sentence", "N" for "noun", "V" for "verb", and P for "phrase". See <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree>Wikipedia on Parse Trees</a> for more information.</figcaption></figure><p>Computer languages are also represented using syntax trees! When the code (high-level) gets translated into instructions for the computer (low-level), a program called <em>compiler</em> make uses of them. The Concrete Syntax Trees for a program contains a lot of detailed information, from whitespaces to language expressions, so you can imagine a CST for a real-world JavaScript program as something really lengthy.<p class=note>What compilers do might be tough to understand at first, but think of this program inside us that converts languages to meaning – our <b>internal <i>compiler</i></b>. Kids improve their compilers while communicating with their families, so every day they get to understand their mother language even more. If you understand English yet struggle with German, we can say your <i>German compiler is pretty bad and has to be improved</i>.<p>The compiler simplifies the CST down to the expressions that truly represent the program after syntax analysis. That’s where the <strong>Abstract Syntax Tree</strong> (AST) comes in: the syntax tree that actually lies at the heart of semantic definitions!<p>Let’s consider the following JavaScript program:<pre class=language-js data-lang=js style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>let </span><span style=color:#fff>x </span><span style=color:#ff79c6>= </span><span style=color:#bd93f9>0
</span><span>

</span><span>    </span><span style=color:#fff>x</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>++
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>This is the Abstract Syntax Tree for it:<figure class=text-center><picture><img alt="Concrete Syntax Tree of the sentence 'The water drank a glass of Mary.'" src=../../media/2018/abstract-syntax-tree.png width=400></picture><figcaption>Abstract Syntax Tree for a JavaScript program.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s really about the essentials when considering language grammar. If a whitespace means nothing in a language, that won’t show up in the AST.<p>Compare that against <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cst/cst/master/docs/cst-example.png>a Concrete Syntax Tree for another program of similar size</a>, which is way more detailed, and therefore more useful in a language-specification level.<h3 id=style-guides>Style guides</h3><p>When the same expression can be written in several ways because the language is not strict enough about it, style guides aim to answer the question of <strong>which style to go for</strong>. Curiously, style guides of writing are just as useful for programmers as they are for journalists!<p>Let’s say I’m telling someone my favourite fruits. I could do it in different ways:<pre class=language-js data-lang=js style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=color:#fff>My favourite fruits are watermelon</span><span>, </span><span style=color:#fff>bananas and strawberries</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>.
