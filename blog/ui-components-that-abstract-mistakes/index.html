But let me tell you about something that matters.<p>Everything is made up of <code>&LTdiv></code>s and <code>&LTspan></code>s again, utterly hidden behind abstractions proudly called components. No one seems to remember <em>(or do they?)</em> the difference between <code>p</code> and <code>span</code>, let alone the point of using <code>section</code> rather than <code>div</code>.<p>Bad decisions ‚Äì to not just to say bad and even invalid HTML markup¬†‚Äì are buried in components developers find awesome to compose user interfaces with.

Nice! You could do it like this:<pre class=language-js data-lang=js style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>const </span><span style=color:#50fa7b>Button </span><span style=color:#ff79c6>= </span><span>({ </span><span style=color:#ffb86c;font-style:italic>onClick</span><span>, </span><span style=color:#ffb86c;font-style:italic>children </span><span>}) </span><span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>=> </span><span>(

</span></code></pre><p>It looks good! You were born for this, weren‚Äôt you?<p>Quite easy to miss what‚Äôs wrong when components are just used like that. A button, isn‚Äôt it? The engineering team can easily grasp what that means and what that does, after all.<p>It could also be a <code>&LTFormLabel /></code> or <code>&LTParagraph /></code> as <code>span</code> elements, or <code>div</code>s all over that place. Although they all work, mistakes are abstracted in components.<p class=note>I specifically talk about markup as the mistake throughout this article, however it could be anything really. Components look inoffensive when you're using them.<h2 id=the-web-isn-t-your-abstraction>The web isn‚Äôt your abstraction</h2><p>Now that HTML is all abstracted through JavaScript libraries and frameworks (which is not wrong), I wonder whether developers only went for semantic elements for the sake of making markup more readable for themselves. With React, your <code>&LTHeader></code> now may be a <code>div</code>. Out of the abstraction, though, you‚Äôd think twice before going for a <code>div</code> to make a header¬†‚Äì you‚Äôd rather use HTML5‚Äôs <code>header</code>.<p><strong>Because of the abstraction, output markup isn‚Äôt something we talk that much about anymore.</strong><p>Did we really get the benefits of HTML5 and why new elements were introduced? Why <code>button</code>? <sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#2>2</a></sup> What‚Äôs <code>header</code> useful for? Why should one use <code>section</code> at all?<p class=note>By the way, do you know how many occurrences of <code>header</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>section</code> I've found on Netflix's landing page? Zero. It's all div soup.<p>Matter of fact is that browser engines and people ‚Äì nothing less than¬†the ones who you really write code for ‚Äì won‚Äôt ever know about your abstractions. A screen reader won‚Äôt know your ‚Äúbutton‚Äù is actually a button<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#3>3</a></sup>. (They will definitely get to know the <code>span</code> though, and that won‚Äôt help.)<figure class=text-center><picture><img alt="xkcd, comic #1444" src=https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tags.png></picture><figcaption><a href=http://xkcd.com/1144>xkcd: Tags</a></figcaption></figure><p>Also, it‚Äôs never been easier to write invalid markup without even realizing it! After React, it seems acceptable to place a <code>button</code> inside an anchor link, and even giant elephants inside <code>span</code>. Has anyone ever thought why they are considered invalid markup in the first place?<h2 id=don-t-make-it-hard>Don‚Äôt make it hard</h2><p>Browsers and assistive technologies are smarter than ever<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#4>4</a></sup>, indeed, yet they still count on developers to write code they can understand and people can benefit from.
