      Catalysis

  <p>As a High School student, I remember always finding Chemistry something between the boring and intriguing. Still, it isn’t hard to find myself wondering about the science concepts I’ve learned at that time.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been particularly thinking about <em>catalysis</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>In Chemistry, catalysis is the acceleration of a reaction due to the participation of a substance – the “catalyst”.</p>
<p>The way a catalyst induces a reaction to happen faster is intriguing. Curiously, it neither gives the reaction more energy nor change its environmental conditions. Catalysts have an even better strategy: they <strong>lower the amount of energy required</strong> for the reaction to take place.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;"><picture><img class="normal-img" src="../../media/2017/catalysis-diagram.png" srcset="../../media/2017/catalysis-diagram_2x.png 2x" alt="Diagrama representando conhecimento como ele realmente é"></picture>
<figcaption>Uncatalyzed reaction (solid) vs. catalyzed reaction (dashed). The highest point is the energy required for the reaction to happen. </figcaption></figure>
<p>In a catalysed reaction, then, the same product is obtained for less energy. Bringing this concept to our lives is quite thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Sometimes it isn’t possible for us to achieve something because it demands <em>more</em> time or energy than what we currently have. To deal with this, we then try looking for them in our lives – which mostly means depriving yourself of things.</p>
<p>However, matter of fact is that optimising isn’t always about getting rid of things in your life. If we think of catalysis, we can manage it differently.</p>
<p>What if the problem weren’t the lack of energy or time, but that we’re in need of <em>too much</em> of them in order to get things done? <strong>Having a catalyst would totally figure it out</strong>. Without something that pushes us forward, we’ll always require more energy for the product we want to get.</p>
<p>At this point, you may think your catalyst is your motivation. Motivation is out of our control though – which makes it a goal, not a source. It’s also too ephemeral, and a catalyst mustn’t ever be consumed by an unique reaction, just like in Chemistry. We can’t count on being motivated!</p>
<p>So it goes more like what <em>habitual and practical</em> things in life would give you productivity for less. Is it everyday meditation? A partner by your side? Self-confidence? Inspiring weekends without thinking of work at all? Eating healthy? Going out for a walk every day?</p>
<p>You have to mind what pushes your forward. Catalysts themselves cannot make a reaction happen that wouldn’t happen on its own, but they sure make it occur under less extreme conditions. It’s an improvement when you’re already motivated.</p>
<p>So, what’s your catalyst?</p>
